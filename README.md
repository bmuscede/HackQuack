# HackQuack
HQ question answering app for Android devices. It connects to HQ and then, during games, displays a notification with the correct answer. HQ can be played normally as this app is running.

## Notices
**NOTE:** This app is purely for entertainment. I wanted to see if I could build a cool HQ-answering app by pulling information from HQ's data websocket. Please play fair!

**NOTE:** This app will not work without your HQ account's authorization code. If no authorization code is supplied, the app start button will not be enabled.
